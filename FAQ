Q1. I receive a error msg of (invalid-read-syntax "#") when loading go-mode/default.
A1. you can manual remove go-mode/default in ~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-*/snippets/.
    Or downgrade yasnippet package to version 0.9.0.1.

Q2. Which command or key-binding use often.
A2. you can have a look at key-binding.org.

Q3. My emacs takes long time to start.
A3. Always run emacs as daemon. (emacs --daemon)
    And then use emacsclient. eg. /usr/bin/emacsclient -c -a emacs  [file].

Q4. Any rules of key-binding.
A4. I think there are serveral rules of key-binding.
    1) you may found that the frequency of key-binding you used is always ordered by C-key, M-key, C-x key, C-c key.
    2) M-key always do more thing than C-key. eg. C-d, M-d.
    3) C-x key always do more thing than C-x C-key. eg. C-x s.

Q5. How to config emacs.
A5. The basic you should know is that emacs config file starts from ~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.el, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el.
    And write an el file containing (provide '[filename]) can be used by other config file by (require '[filename]) when it's parent dir in the load-path.

Q6. My emacs can't maximize in kde.
A6. Just right click at emacs window, choose Window-Specific Settings->Size&Position->Obey geometry restrictions->Force->Noï¼›Window matching->Window title->Regular Expression->.*.

Q7. How to use color theme in xterm.
A7. try "env TERM=xterm-256color emacs".

Q8. What command support multiple-cursors.
A8. isearch-forward and isearch-backward aren't supported with multiple cursors. If you want this functionality, you can use phi-search.
    Commands run with M-x won't be repeated for all cursors.
    All key bindings that refer to lambdas are always run for all cursors. If you need to limit it, you will have to give it a name.
    Redo might screw with your cursors. Undo works very well.

Q9. How to use cpputils-cmake.
A9. For simply use to setup code completion.
    First, edit CMakeLists.txt like this:
        project(test)
        set(SOURCES main.cpp)
        include_directories(src /usr/include)
        add_executable(test ${SOURCES})
    And then touch target(test) in build directory.

Q10. What to do when emacs hangs or crash.
A10. First, try C-g. If it doesn't work, you may need to kill emacs.
     After emacs crashed, try recover-session to recover everything if you're lucky.

Q11. How to use projectile.
A11. Projectile works well with vc tools(eg. git),
     but sometimes you may want to search in some files,
     try write .projectile file to instruct Projectile to ignore certain files in a project.
     there is an example:
           +/src
           -/src/foo
           -/src/*.d
           -/src/*/*.d
     keep these in mind:
          + only supports subdirectories(- supports more).
          * matches strings not containing '/'.

Q12. How to use emacs in window nt(w32 version).
A12. Step 1: Install msys2 and then run mingw32-setup.sh with mingw32.exe
     to install nessary package,
     with -r to fully upgrade packages if you're in china.
     Step 2: set the environment variable HOME to your home directory,
     and set ALTERNATE_EDITOR to runemacs.exe,
     and Add path to mingw32/bin and usr/bin to PATH.
     Now, set emacsclientw.exe as your default editor.
