Q4. Any rules of key-binding.
A4. I think there are serveral rules of key-binding.
	1) you may found that the frequency of key-binding you used is always ordered by C-key, M-key, C-x key, C-c key.
	2) M-key always do more thing than C-key. eg. C-d, M-d.
	3) C-x key always do more thing than C-x C-key. eg. C-x s.

Q5. How to config emacs.
A5. The basic you should know is that emacs config file starts from ~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.el, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el.
	And write an el file containing (provide '[filename]) can be used by other config file by (require '[filename]) when it's parent dir in the load-path.

Q7. How to use color theme in xterm.
A7. try "env TERM=xterm-256color emacs".
	
Q8. What command support multiple-cursors.
A8. isearch-forward and isearch-backward aren't supported with multiple cursors. If you want this functionality, you can use phi-search.
    Commands run with M-x won't be repeated for all cursors.
    All key bindings that refer to lambdas are always run for all cursors. If you need to limit it, you will have to give it a name.
    Redo might screw with your cursors. Undo works very well.
